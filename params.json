It was developed to facilitate easy async SQLite use in iOS apps, specifically apps that use some sort of a sync model between the device and server on a background process, and has resulted in a simple and powerful library.\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Add JTLDB as a submodule of you project\r\n```\r\n$ git submodule add git://github.com/jtlsystems/JTLDB.git  \r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add the JTLDB project to your XCode Workspace\r\n\r\n## How to Use JTLDB to achieve data layer separation, data model versioning and easy entity creation from read statements\r\nPlease checkout the [JTLDB Demo Project]() __COMING SOON__ for a good example of how to effectively use JTLDB.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nWant to contribute?
